/**
 * Octo non-custodial SDK (internal module; extractable to `@octo/sdk`).
 *
 * The full client-side flow: generate/recover a key, encrypt it for backup, build + sign
 * transactions locally, and relay the signed XDR to Octo. The private key never leaves here.
 *
 * Password hygiene: the decrypted keypair is only needed for the instant of signing. Callers
 * must clear the password from state in a `finally` right after signing and never retain the
 * `Keypair` in state or refs beyond the submit function.
